- report packet generation and file writers
- synthetic radio prototype, diagnostic placeholders, and injection helpers
- synthetic infrared prototype
- synthetic archival anomaly prototype

Validation before commit:

```bash

git diff --check
```

```

Merge status: already on `main`; no merge needed.

---

## Config/CI Step 10 — First CI Workflow

Status: deferred.

Reason:

- GitHub rejected the push because the current Personal Access Token does not have `workflow` scope.
- Do not include `.github/workflows/ci.yml` in pushed history until the project owner pushes with a token that has `workflow` scope.
- The intended workflow should run Python 3.11, install `.[dev]`, run non-live tests with coverage, run Ruff, and run mypy.

Validation for this step should include:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest --cov=techno_search --cov-report=term-missing
.venv/bin/python -m ruff check .
.venv/bin/python -m mypy src
git diff --check
```

Merge status: already on `main`; no merge needed.

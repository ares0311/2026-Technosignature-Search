# Batch Manifests

Raw acquisition batches must be planned here before download when the batch is
driven by the target-priority queue.

Required fields are defined by `docs/astrometrics_data_selection_policy.md`:

- `batch_id`
- `project`
- `role`
- `acquisition_mode`
- `target_queue_snapshot`
- `source_archive`
- `query`
- `estimated_download_gb`
- `max_allowed_download_gb`
- `expected_raw_files`
- `expected_derived_gb`
- `free_space_before_gb`
- `free_space_required_after_gb`
- `eviction_rule`
- `pin_rule`
- `stop_condition`
- `manifest_owner`
- `created_at`

Do not use a batch manifest as approval to download raw files until archive
product metadata, size estimates, and local free-space constraints have been
verified.

## Six-shard single-terminal launcher

Once an explicitly approved batch has six committed, disjoint manifests named
`<PREFIX>_shard1_manifest.json` through `<PREFIX>_shard6_manifest.json`, run the
repo-native launcher instead of opening six terminal tabs. Always dry-run the
same prefix first:

```bash
git pull origin main
caffeinate -i .venv/bin/python scripts/run_six_shard_downloads.py \
  data_selection/batch_manifests/<PREFIX> --dry-run
```

Remove `--dry-run` only after the printed target count, 100GB storage preflight,
six manifest paths, and approval state are correct. The launcher defaults to six
pipeline workers per shard, but permits only two shards to post-process at once
(12 aggregate workers); all six download shards remain independently logged.
It refuses a completed manifest unless `--rerun-completed` is deliberately
supplied. That override is not routine resume behavior: the underlying runner
already skips targets with existing `.dat` plus candidate-report evidence.

## Batch naming convention

Each acquisition round (`top25`, `next25`, `batch3`, ...) gets its own
discovery manifest, discovery-result file, size-preflight manifest, and
size-preflight report — this preserves that round's real discovered URLs,
skipped targets, and measured sizes as a distinct, reviewable artifact.
`techno-search build-target-priority-queue` merges **every**
`*_size_preflight_report.json` and every `*_discovery_result.json` file
committed under this directory (see `--extra-size-preflight-report-path` /
`--extra-discovery-result-path`, both default: auto-glob), so a later
round's report/result does not regress an earlier round's promotion or
"no HDF5 URL found" outcome.

Because of that merge, the raw-download **approval manifest** is not
per-round — it is regenerated as one consolidated, always-current file
covering every target currently promoted to
`raw_download_approval_required` across all rounds so far:
`local_coverage_raw_download_approval_manifest.json`. Regenerate it after
each new round's size preflight completes and the queue is rebuilt.

**Real bug found and fixed, 2026-07-10:** `docs/data_collection_status.json`
keeps only the single most recent `download_bl_extended_corpus_discovery`
run, so once `next25`'s discovery ran, `top25`'s 10 "no HDF5 URL found"
targets were no longer visible to `build-target-priority-queue` and
silently fell back to `queued_metadata_discovery` — they resurfaced as
10 of the 25 targets in a first `batch3` manifest attempt, which would have
wasted a repeat live-network check on targets already known to have no
current URL. This is the same class of bug already fixed for size-preflight
reports (`--extra-size-preflight-report-path`, see the `next25` entry in
`docs/LOCAL_DATA_INVENTORY.md`) — just not yet applied to discovery
results. Fixed with the analogous mechanism
(`--extra-discovery-result-path` / `*_discovery_result.json`, see
`scripts/download_bl_extended_corpus.sh --discovery-result-output` for how
future rounds should persist their own result durably). `top25`'s and
`next25`'s original discovery outcomes were reconstructed from
already-committed evidence (each round's discovery manifest minus that
round's size-preflight manifest is exactly the checked-but-no-URL set) —
not guessed — and committed as
`local_coverage_top25_discovery_result.json` /
`local_coverage_next25_discovery_result.json`. `batch3` was then
regenerated cleanly with zero overlap against `top25`/`next25`.

Starting with `batch3`, `breakthroughinitiatives.org` discovery still needs
the user's own machine (not reachable from this agent's sandbox proxy), but
`bldata.berkeley.edu` HEAD-only size-preflight requests are reachable from
here, so this agent runs preflight/queue-rebuild/manifest-regen itself once
the user pastes back a discovery-result file.

Every round follows the same four files:
`local_coverage_<round>_manifest.json` (the round's 25
`queued_metadata_discovery` targets, downloader-compatible for
`scripts/download_bl_extended_corpus.sh --manifest ... --discover-only`),
`local_coverage_<round>_discovery_result.json` (durable available+skipped
outcome), `local_coverage_<round>_size_preflight_manifest.json` (the
URL-discovered subset), and `local_coverage_<round>_size_preflight_report.json`
(HEAD-only size/checksum results). None of these authorize a raw download by
themselves.

| Round | Checked | Available (URL found) | Skipped (no URL) | Preflight verified | Size (GB) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `top25` | 25 | 15 | 10 | 15/15 | 3.803966 | discovery result reconstructed from committed evidence, 2026-07-10 (see below) |
| `next25` | 25 | 14 | 11 | 14/14 | 3.608361 | discovery result reconstructed from committed evidence, 2026-07-10 (see below) |
| `batch3` | 25 | 14 | 11 | 14/14 | 3.481361 | first round captured live via `--discovery-result-output` |
| `batch4` | 25 | 19 | 6 | 19/19 | 4.79346 | captured live |

**Switched to one bulk round after `batch13`, 2026-07-11:** at 25
targets/round, the remaining queue (1,358 targets after `batch13`) would
have needed ~55 more manual discovery rounds, each requiring the user to
copy-paste a command — the user flagged this as unsustainable
("How many times are we doing to do this?"). `local_coverage_batch14_bulk_manifest.json`
covers all 1,358 remaining `queued_metadata_discovery` targets in one
manifest (zero overlap with `top25`/`next25`/`batch3`-`batch13`, confirmed).
This does not change the discovery script's request pattern — it is still
one sequential HEAD/GET request per target, same as every prior round, just
run to completion in a single invocation instead of 55 separate ones. Not a
change to acquisition role/mode/rate; still `--discover-only`, no payloads.

**Discovery script hardened before this round ran, 2026-07-11:** the
sequential-only script had no progress/ETA output and no concurrency, which
the user flagged as non-compliant with the project's visible-progress
directive for a ~50-60 minute unattended run. Added bounded-parallel workers
(`TECHNO_EXTENDED_CORPUS_DISCOVERY_WORKERS`, default 4) and a
`[PROGRESS] X/Y checked (elapsed Xm, ETA ~Ym remaining)` line every 10th
completion. Real observed runtime for the full 1,358-target run: **13m53s**
wall-clock (vs. the ~50-60 min sequential estimate) — ETA tracked actual
completion closely throughout (e.g. predicted ~12m remaining at 10% done,
finished within the predicted window).

| `batch14_bulk` | 1358 | 936 | 422 | 936/936 | 235.825276 | discovery + size-preflight both captured live with the new bounded-parallel/ETA discovery script; `all_targets_ok: true` |

`local_coverage_raw_download_approval_manifest.json` — the consolidated,
always-current set of sized HDF5 rows promoted to
`raw_download_approval_required` across all rounds so far: **1,147 targets,
~288.97 GB combined** (as of the `batch14_bulk` round). This is the
human-review input for an explicitly approved bounded raw download; it is
not approval by itself. Regenerate it after each new round's size preflight
completes and the queue is rebuilt.

**Hard local storage constraint set, 2026-07-11:** the user confirmed there
is no external SSD and no cloud storage available for this project — the
local data footprint is capped at 100GB, permanently (see the "Current
Reality Override" sections added to `docs/astrometrics_data_selection_policy.md`
and `docs/astrometrics_external_and_cloud_storage_policy.md`, and
`TECHNO_LOCAL_STORAGE_CAP_GB` in `scripts/download_bl_extended_corpus.sh`).
This means the 1,147-target/~289GB approval manifest above is a
**priority-ranked wishlist, not a download plan** — it is roughly 3x the
entire cap and could never be downloaded in bulk. Continuing to discover
and size-preflight the full BL archive against this queue is still useful
(it's free, no payloads), but any actual raw download must be a small,
bounded `stream_process_evict` batch sized to fit the real remaining
headroom (~91GB as of this round: 100GB cap − ~9GB current usage), run
through turboSETI/pipeline immediately, then evicted before pulling the
next batch. Not yet requested by the user; this is scope-setting only.

**Real bug found and fixed during `batch6`, 2026-07-11:** target
`DENIS-P J1048.0-3956` broke the discovery curl call with `curl: (3) URL
rejected: Malformed input to a URL function`, because
`discover_hdf5_url()` interpolated the raw target name directly into the
query string instead of percent-encoding it -- any target name containing
a space or other URL-reserved character corrupted the request. Fixed by
switching to `curl -G --data-urlencode`, which encodes each query
parameter correctly. This also surfaced a second, related correctness gap:
a curl transport/request failure and a genuine "no HDF5 file for this
target" response were both recorded under the identical
`no_hdf5_url_discovered` reason, silently conflating a technical failure
with confirmed negative evidence. `discover_hdf5_url()` now returns a
distinct exit code for each case, and the caller records
`discovery_request_failed` for the former. Two regression tests added
(`test_extended_corpus_downloader_url_encodes_target_names_with_spaces`,
`test_extended_corpus_downloader_distinguishes_request_failure_from_no_match`).
`DENIS-P J1048.0-3956` itself was checked with the *pre-fix* script during
this round and was recorded as `no_hdf5_url_discovered` in
`local_coverage_batch6_discovery_result.json`, although that request had not
actually succeeded. The fixed URL-encoded one-target retry completed on
2026-07-14 and found no current GBT HDF5 product; the durable result is
`local_coverage_batch6_retry_discovery_result.json`. The same run exposed and
fixed a second status-semantics bug: a successfully completed zero-product
query is now `ok: true`, while any `discovery_request_failed` outcome still
fails closed. No raw payload was downloaded.

**Coverage-state bug fixed, queue corrected, Step 3a batch 1 proposed —
2026-07-17:** `target_priority_queue._load_coverage_state()` never read the
`stream_process_evict_batch__*` run keys under
`docs/data_collection_status.json`, so the 198 targets from the Step 0
bounded batch (already downloaded, processed, and evicted) stayed listed as
`raw_download_approval_required` (see `docs/DECISIONS.md` DECISION-155).
Fixed; the consolidated approval manifest above is now 949 targets
(~239.06 GB), not 1,147 (~288.97 GB).

From the corrected queue, `local_coverage_step3a_batch1_manifest.json`
proposes the next bounded batch: the top 198 targets by `total_priority`
that fit within a 50 GB budget (198 targets, 49.963 GB — sized consistently
with the Step 0 precedent), independently confirmed to have zero overlap
with any target already recorded downloaded in
`docs/data_collection_status.json`. Real local storage usage as of this
round is ~9GB against the permanent 100GB cap (~91GB headroom), so this
batch fits comfortably even before eviction.

**Downloaded, processed, and evicted — 2026-07-17, same day:** the user
approved this batch, the sandbox network fix above was applied and
live-verified, and `scripts/run_six_shard_downloads.py` ran it end-to-end:
198/198 targets downloaded (49.962586GB, matching the manifest), processed
through turboSETI, and evicted; all six shard run entries recorded
`ok: true`. Re-running `build-target-priority-queue` moved all 198 targets
`raw_download_approval_required` → `already_acquired_local_cache` (412
total already-acquired, 751 remaining). The consolidated approval manifest
is now regenerated to 751 targets (~189.10GB). See
`docs/PRODUCTION_READINESS.md` for the full result and a real
`scan-summary`/`--json` bug this run surfaced and fixed.

**Step 3a batch 3 proposed — 2026-07-18:** following the same pattern as
batches 1-2 (DECISION-157, DECISION-158), `local_coverage_step3a_batch3_manifest.json`
proposes the next bounded batch from the 557-target `raw_download_approval_required`
queue left after batch 2: the top targets by `total_priority` (descending,
stable order) that fit within the 50 GB budget without exceeding it. **199
targets, 49.988002 GB** (loaded and summed directly from the manifest JSON,
not estimated) — the 200th-ranked target would have pushed the total to
50.252355 GB, over budget. Independently confirmed **zero overlap** against
every target already recorded downloaded in `docs/data_collection_status.json`
(union of `download_bl_extended_corpus`'s `reused_targets`/`downloaded_targets`
plus every `ok: true` `stream_process_evict` run's `downloaded_targets` — 607
targets tracked, 0 in common with this batch's 199).

Sharded into six disjoint manifests,
`local_coverage_step3a_batch3_shard{1-6}_manifest.json` (34/33/33/33/33/33
targets, remainder distributed to shard 1), each summing exactly to its
listed `estimated_download_gb` and together covering all 199 targets with no
duplication. Dry-run validated via
`python scripts/run_six_shard_downloads.py data_selection/batch_manifests/local_coverage_step3a_batch3 --dry-run`:
6 shards, 199 targets, worst-case storage 9.03GB current + 16.13GB
worst-case chunks = 25.16GB / 100.00GB cap.

**Raw download still requires the user's explicit approval and has not been
run.** This entry is a sizing/proposal only, matching the batch 1/batch 2
precedent before their respective approvals.

**Batch 3 execution recorded — 2026-07-19:** all six shard records now report
`ok: true`. Their latest resume summaries contain 196
`already_processed_targets` plus 3 newly downloaded/processed/evicted targets,
covering all 199 manifest targets with zero reported failures. Queue schema v2
now treats both successful completion fields as durable coverage evidence and
ranks by the config-versioned `target_selection_score`, not the retained policy
sum. The regenerated queue has 805 already-acquired targets and 358 remaining
`raw_download_approval_required` targets; the consolidated approval manifest is
89.274678 GB. This is corrected inventory state, not authorization to download
the remaining queue and not a candidate claim.
